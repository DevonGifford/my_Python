# Ep. 33 - Chaining Comparison Operators in Python with Logical Operators

We can use logical operators to combine comparisons:

- and - both need to be true

`1<2 and 2>3
=False`

`('h' == 'h') and 2 == 2
=True`

- or  -  one needs to be true

`100 == 1 or 2 == 200
=False`

- not - return the opposite boolean

`not 1 == 1
=False`
