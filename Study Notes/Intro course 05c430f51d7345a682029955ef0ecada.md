Programming is just a way to give a computer instructions !

we cant speak 1’s & 0’s

Therefore we need to send our source code to a ‘translator’ (i.e. Interpreter or compiler)
Interpreter goes line by line
compiler takes the whole thing

Python is normally refered to as the source code
While actually it is just a interpreter

This comes in various forms but normally comes in a program written in  ‘C’ aka C-Python
This C-Python creates ‘bite code’ 
Then gets run through CYTHON Virtual machine 

When we download python we get the Virtual Machine & the Interpreter
