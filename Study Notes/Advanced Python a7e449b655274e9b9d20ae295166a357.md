# Functional Programming

## What is Functional Programming?

---

<aside>
‚ùó Functional programming is a programming paradigm, a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs,
treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and **avoids changing state and mutable data**.

In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, meaning that they can be treated just like any other value in a program. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values, and assigned to variables.

</aside>

separation of concerns - *each part concerns itself with one part it‚Äôs good at
(organizing our code)*

---

- Functional Programmers separate **data** & **functions**
    
    ---
    
    - They wont combine their functions with the data
    - Emphasis on simplicity, where data and functions are concerned
    - no classes or operations
    - Operate on lists and dictionaries
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùó Functional programming emphasizes immutability, meaning that the state of an object cannot be changed once it is created. Instead of changing an object's state, functional programming often involves creating new objects with the desired updated state. This can make it easier to reason about and debug programs, as the state of an object is not changing unexpectedly.
    
    </aside>
    

- Some of the key benefits of functional programming include
    
    ---
    
    end goal is the same
    
    - make code clear and understandable
    - easy to extend
    - easy to maintain
    - memory efficient
    - DRY - ****Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself****
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùó - improved code readability, 
    - better support for concurrent and parallel programming, and 
    - greater flexibility in software design.
    
    </aside>
    

- In Python
    
    In Python, functional programming is achieved by **using functions as first-class citizens** and by **avoiding changing state and mutable data.**
    
    Python provides several built-in functions that can be used to implement functional programming techniques, such as **`map`**, **`filter`**, and **`reduce`**, which allow you to apply a function to a sequence of elements and return a new sequence.
    
    Python also provides higher-order functions, such as **`sorted`**, which takes a function as an argument and uses it to determine the order in which to sort a sequence.
    
    To achieve immutability in Python, you can use the **`tuple`** type, which is an immutable sequence type. You can also use the **`frozenset`** type, which is an immutable set type.
    
    In addition to the built-in functional programming features in Python, there are also several third-party libraries that provide additional functional programming tools and techniques, such as **`functools`** and **`toolz`**.
    
    Overall, functional programming in Python involves using functions and immutable data to build programs that are concise, expressive, and easy to reason about and debug.
    

## Pure Functions

---

*There is only one pillar in functional programming ‚Ä¶. ‚Äúpure functions‚Äù*

- What are pure functions?
    
    <aside>
    ü§î Pure functions are an important concept in functional programming, as they are easier to reason about and debug than functions that have side effects or depend on external state. Because pure functions always return the same output for a given set of inputs, it is easier to understand how they will behave and to predict the results of calling them.
    
    </aside>
    

- **Pure functions are functions that have the following 3 characteristics:**
    1. Determinism - 
    *They always return the same output for a given set of inputs. This is called determinism.*
    
    2. No side effects - 
    *meaning that they do not modify any external state or mutable data, and do not produce any observable outputs such as printing to the console or displaying a message on the screen.*
    
    3. They do not depend on any external state or mutable data.
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùó be careful, this can be tricky.  Think very carefully what those rules imply.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    ü§î Pure functions are also easier to test and to reuse in different contexts, as they do not have any dependencies on external state or mutable data.
    
    </aside>
    

- Here is an example of a pure function in Python:
    
    ```python
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
    
    #another example of a pure function
    def multiply_by2(li):
    	new_list = []
    	for item in li:
    		new_list.append(item*2)
    	return new_list
    
    print(multiply_by2([1,2,3]))
    
    ```
    
    This function takes two arguments, **`x`** and **`y`**, and returns their sum. It has no side effects and does not depend on any external state or mutable data, so it is a pure function.
    

---

<aside>
ü§î pure functions are more of a guide line - impossible to have pure functions everywhere, because if a function doesn‚Äôt affect the outside world we would not have any programs.  
*If you can, they would be more optimal* üí™

</aside>

---

### Most common and useful functions in functional programming:

### `map()`

---

a built-in Python function that applies a function to each element of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or string) and returns a new iterable with the modified elements.

- Here is an example of using **`map()`** to apply a function to a list of integers:
    
    ```python
    def double(x):
        return x * 2
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    doubled_numbers = map(double, numbers)
    print(list(doubled_numbers))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î In this example, the **`double()`** function is applied to each element in the **`numbers`** list, and a new iterable **`doubled_numbers`** is returned with the modified elements. The **`map()`** function returns a map object, which is an iterator that produces the modified elements on demand. To create a list from the map object, we use the **`list()`** function.
    
    </aside>
    

---

<aside>
ü§î You can also use **`map()`** with multiple iterables of the same length. In this case, the function should take multiple arguments, one for each iterable.

</aside>

- For example:
    
    ```python
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y
    
    numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    numbers2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    result = map(multiply, numbers1, numbers2)
    print(list(result))   
    >
    [5, 12, 21, 32]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î  In this example, the **`multiply()`** function is applied to pairs of elements from the **`numbers1`** and **`numbers2`** lists, and a new iterable **`result`** is returned with the modified elements.
    
    </aside>
    

---

- **`map()`** is often used in functional programming to apply a function to a sequence of elements and return a new sequence, without changing the original data.
- It is a more concise and readable alternative to using a **`for`** loop to iterate over the sequence and apply the function to each element.

### `filter()`

---

a built-in Python function that takes a function and an iterable as arguments and returns a new iterable with only the elements that satisfy a certain condition.

- The function passed to **`filter()`** should take a single argument and return a boolean value indicating whether the element should be included in the new iterable.
- **`filter()`** will include an element in the new iterable if the function returns **`True`**, and will exclude it if the function returns **`False`**.
- Here is an example of using **`filter()`** to select only the even numbers from a list:
    
    ```python
     def is_even(x):
        return x % 2 == 0
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    even_numbers = filter(is_even, numbers)
    print(list(even_numbers))  # [2, 4, 6]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î  In this example, the **`is_even()`** function is applied to each element in the **`numbers`** list, and a new iterable **`even_numbers`** is returned with only the even numbers. 
    The **`filter()`** function returns a filter object, which is an iterator that produces the filtered elements on demand. To create a list from the filter object, we use the **`list()`** function.
    
    </aside>
    

---

<aside>
ü§î You can also use the **`filter()`** function with multiple arguments by providing a function that takes multiple arguments. In this case, **`filter()`**
 will pass the elements from each iterable as separate arguments to the function.

</aside>

- For example:
    
    ```python
     def multiply_if_even(x, y):
        if x % 2 == 0 and y % 2 == 0:
            return x * y
        else:
            return None
    
    numbers1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    numbers2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    result = filter(multiply_if_even, numbers1, numbers2)
    print(list(result))  # [30, 48]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î  In this example, the **`multiply_if_even()`**
     function is applied to pairs of elements from the **`numbers1`**
     and **`numbers2`**
     lists, and a new iterable **`result`**
     is returned with only the elements that are both even.
    
    </aside>
    

---

- **`filter()`**is often used in functional programming to select a subset of elements from a sequence based on a certain condition, without changing the original data. It is a more concise and readable alternative to using a **`for`** loop to iterate over the sequence and apply the condition to each element.

### `zip()`

---

a built-in Python function that takes one or more iterables as arguments and returns a new iterable of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from each of the input iterables.

- Here is an example of using **`zip()`** to combine two lists into a list of tuples:
    
    ```python
    names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
    ages = [25, 30, 35]
    combined = zip(names, ages)
    print(list(combined))  # [('Alice', 25), ('Bob', 30), ('Charlie', 35)]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î In this example, the **`zip()`** function takes the **`names`** and **`ages`** lists as arguments and returns a new iterable **`combined`** with tuples containing the corresponding elements from each list. 
    
    The **`zip()`** function returns a zip object, which is an iterator that produces the tuples on demand. To create a list from the zip object, we use the **`list()`** function.
    
    </aside>
    

---

<aside>
ü§î You can also use **`zip()`** with more than two iterables. In this case, the returned tuples will contain the corresponding elements from each iterable. For example:

</aside>

- For example:
    
    ```python
     names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
    ages = [25, 30, 35]
    genders = ['F', 'M', 'M']
    combined = zip(names, ages, genders)
    print(list(combined))  # [('Alice', 25, 'F'), ('Bob', 30, 'M'), ('Charlie', 35, 'M')]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î **`zip()`** is often used to iterate over multiple iterables at the same time, or to create a new iterable from multiple iterables. It is a convenient and concise way to combine elements from multiple iterables into tuples.
    
    </aside>
    

---

- Note that **`zip()`**
 will only produce tuples as long as the shortest input iterable. If the input iterables have different lengths, the returned iterable will have the same length as the shortest input iterable.

### `reduced()`

---

**`reduce()`** is a built-in Python function that applies a function to a sequence of elements and reduces them to a single value. It is part of the **`functools`** module, so you will need to import it before you can use it.

**`reduce()`** takes a function and a sequence as arguments and applies the function to the elements of the sequence in a cumulative way, from left to right. The function should take two arguments and return a single value.

<aside>
‚ùó Remember that you need to import reduce

```python
from functools import reduce
```

</aside>

- Here is an example of using **`reduce()`** to compute the product of a list of integers:
    
    ```python
    from functools import reduce
    
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    product = reduce(multiply, numbers)
    print(product)  # 24
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùì In this example, the **`multiply()`** function is applied to the elements of the **`numbers`** list in a cumulative way, starting with the first two elements, then the result and the next element, and so on. The final result is a single value, which is the product of all the elements in the list.
    
    </aside>
    

---

<aside>
‚ùï You can also use the optional **`initializer`** argument to specify a starting value for the reduction. In this case, the function will be applied to the initializer and the first element of the sequence, then to the result and the next element, and so on. For example:

</aside>

- For example:
    
    ```python
    from functools import reduce
    
    def multiply(x, y):
        return x * y
    
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    product = reduce(multiply, numbers, 10)
    print(product)  # 240
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùì In this example, the **`multiply()`** function is applied to the initial value of **`10`** and the first element of the **`numbers`** list, then to the result and the next element, and so on. The final result is a single value, which is the product of all the elements in the list, multiplied by the initial value of **`10`**
    
    </aside>
    

---

<aside>
ü§î **`reduce()`** is often used in functional programming to perform a computation on a sequence of elements and reduce them to a single value. It is a more concise and expressive way to perform a reduction than using a loop to iterate over the elements and perform the computation manually.

## Lambda Expressions

---

Also known as **anonymous functions** in other languages. 
Lambda expressions, are a way to create small, **single-use functions** without having to define a full function using the **`def`** keyword.

> They are commonly used in functional programming to create functions that are passed as arguments to other functions or used to transform data.
> 

- In Python, lambda expressions are written using:
    - the **`lambda`** keyword,
    - followed by one or more arguments, a colon, and
    - the function body.
    
    > The function body can only contain a single expression, which is returned as the result of the function. Here is an example of a lambda expression that takes a single argument and returns its square:
    > 

```python
square = lambda x: x * x
#You can then use the lambda expression just like any other function, by calling it with the appropriate arguments. For example
result = square(5)  # 25

#another example

my_list = [5,4,3]

print (list(map(lambda item: item*item, my_list)))
>
[25, 16, 9]
[Finished in 69ms]
```

```python
#This could also be done in a print statementfor example

my_list = [1,2,3]
print (my_list)

print(list(map(lambda item: item * 2, my_list)))
print(list(filter(lambda item: item % 2 != 0, my_list)))
print(reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, my_list))

>
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 4, 6]
[1, 3]
6
[Finished in 69ms]
```

<aside>
‚ùó Lambda expressions are often used with built-in functions like **`map()`**, **`filter()`**, and **`reduce()`**, which take functions as arguments and apply them to sequences of data.

</aside>

- For example:
    
    you can use a lambda expression with **`map()`** to apply a function to a sequence of elements and return a new sequence:
    
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    doubled_numbers = map(lambda x: x * 2, numbers)
    print(list(doubled_numbers))  # [2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î In this example, the lambda expression **`lambda x: x * 2`**
     is passed as an argument to **`map()`**, which applies the function to each element in the **`numbers`** list and returns a new iterable with the modified elements.
    
    </aside>
    

---

- Lambda expressions are useful when you only need to use a function in a single place and don't want to define a full function using the **`def`** keyword.
- Useful for creating simple functions on the fly, without having to give them a name.
- However, they can make your code harder to read and debug if overused, as they do not have a name that can be used to identify them.

- Exercise
    
    ```python
    #sort the list by the second item
    
    a = [(0,2), (4,3), (10,-1)]
    
    #attempt 1
    #print(list(sorted(map(lambda item: item[1], a))))
    
    #attempt2
    #print(list(sorted(tuple(map(lambda item: item, a)))))
    
    #Final Answer
    a.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
    print (a)
    
    >
    [(10, -1), (0, 2), (4, 3)]
    ```

## Set, List & Dictionary Comprehensions

---

<aside>
ü§î very unique to the python language

</aside>

‚ÄòComprehensions‚Äô are concise ways to create new lists, sets, and dictionaries, respectively, from existing iterables. 

They are similar to for loops, but are more concise and can be more readable, especially when working with complex data structures.

---

### `list`

---

List comprehensions have the following syntax:

```python
my_something = [expression for item in iterable]
```

For example, the following list comprehension generates a new list of the squares of the numbers 0 through 9:

```python
#instead of doing this

my_list = []

for char in 'hello':
	my_list.append(char)

print(my_list)
>
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

#We can use list comprehension

my_list2 = [x for x in 'hello']
print (my_list2)
>
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

my_list3 = [num for num in range(0,11)]
print (my_list3)
>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

my_list4 = [num*2 for num in range(0,11)]
print (my_list4)
>
**[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]**

my_list5 = [num**2 for num in range(0,11) if num % 2 == 0]
print (my_list5)
>
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64, 100]
```

### `set`

---

Set comprehensions have a similar syntax to list comprehensions, but use curly braces instead of square brackets:

```python
{expression for item in iterable}
```

For example, the following set comprehension generates a new set of the lowercase vowels:

```python
>>> {char for char in 'aeiou'}
{'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}

my_list = []
#We can use set comprehension

my_list2 = {x for x in 'hello'}
print (my_list2)
>
{'o', 'e', 'l', 'h'}

my_list3 = {num for num in range(0,11)}
print (my_list3)
>
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

my_list5 = {num**2 for num in range(0,11) if num % 2 == 0}
print (my_list5)
>
{0, 64, 4, 36, 100, 16}
```

### `dictionary`

---

Dictionary comprehensions have the following syntax:

```python

{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable}
```

For example, the following dictionary comprehension generates a new dictionary that maps the numbers 0 through 9 to their squares:

```python
>>> {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}

#antoher example
simple_dict = {
	'a':1,
	'b':2
}

my_dict = {key:value**2 for key, value in simple_dict.items()}
print (my_dict)
>
{'a': 1, 'b': 4}

#another one
my_dict = {key:value**2 for key, value in simple_dict.items() if value%2==0}
print (my_dict)
>
{'b': 4}

#another one
my_dict = {num:num**2 for num in [1,2,3]}
print (my_dict)
>
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
```

- Exercise
    
    ```python
    some_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'd', 'm', 'n', 'n']
    
    duplicates = []
    for value in some_list:
    	if some_list.count(value) > 1:
    		if value not in duplicates:
    			duplicates.append(value)
    
    print (duplicates)
    
    #create a comprehension that returns same as above, in a list form.  
    
    duplicates_the_2nd = list({value for value in some_list if some_list.count(value) > 1 })
    print (duplicates_the_2nd)
    
    >
    **['b', 'n']
    ['b', 'n']**
    ```
    

## Filtering Comprehensions

---

Comprehensions can also include optional clauses for filtering the items in the iterable. 

> These clauses are written after the **`for`** clause, separated by a **`if`** keyword.
> 

For example, the following list comprehension generates a new list of the even squares from the numbers 0 through 9:

```python
>>> [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
[0, 4, 16, 36, 64]
```

# Decorators

## What are decorators

---

<aside>
‚ùó A decorator is a design pattern to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its code.

</aside>

Decorators are implemented as callable objects (functions, methods, or classes) that take another function as an argument and return a modified version of that function.

- written using the **`@`** symbol, followed by the name of the decorator function.
- applied to a function by placing the **`@`** symbol and the decorator name immediately before the definition of the decorated function.
- For example:
    
    ```python
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            # Code to modify the behavior of the decorated function
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    
    @decorator
    def decorated_function(x):
        return x
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î In this example
    
    - The **`decorator`** function takes a function as an argument (**`func`**) and returns a modified version of that function (**`wrapper`**).
    - The **`decorated_function`** is then decorated by the **`decorator`** function by using the **`@decorator`** syntax.
    - When the **`decorated_function`** is called, it will execute the code inside the **`wrapper`** function, which can modify its behavior in some way.
    </aside>
    

---

- often used to add additional functionality to an existing function, *such as logging, caching, or input validation.*
- can also be used to modify the signature of a function, allowing it to take additional arguments or return a different type of value.
- Decorators can be stacked, meaning that a function can be decorated by multiple decorators.

In this case, the decorators are applied in a bottom-up order, with the innermost decorator being applied first. For example:

```python
 
@decorator_1
@decorator_2
@decorator_3
def decorated_function(x):
    return x

```

In this example, **`decorator_3`** is applied first, followed by **`decorator_2`**, and finally **`decorator_1`**. 

- This is equivalent to writing:
    
    ```python
    def decorated_function(x):
        return x
    decorated_function = decorator_1(decorator_2(decorator_3(decorated_function)))
    ```
    

---

<aside>
üó£ my notes from bootcamp

functions are pretty much just like variables in the way we call on them.  *i.e. first class citizens* 

> this is not the case for all programming languages
> 

---

Decorators:

üëâ A function that wraps another function and enhances it or changes it. 

- supercharge our function and add extra functionality
- tells the interpreter that we are making extra features

So we need to understand this before we can create/write our own decorator

- Higher Order Function
    
    a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as it‚Äôs result. 
    
    > Higher-order functions allow you to abstract over actions and control the flow of your program.
    > 
    - For example:
        
        ```python
        def apply_twice(func, arg):
          return func(func(arg))
        
        def add_five(x):
          return x + 5
        
        print(apply_twice(add_five, 10))  # 20
        ```
        
        <aside>
        ü§î In this example, **`apply_twice()`** is a higher-order function because it takes the function **`add_five()`** as an argument and returns the result of calling **`add_five()`** twice on its argument.
        
        </aside>
        
    
    ---
    
    - Higher-order functions are useful for creating reusable code, as they allow you to write functions that can operate on a wide range of functions and data types.
    - They are an important part of functional programming, a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens in a program.

- So let‚Äôs create our first decorator:
    
    ```jsx
    #simple example
    
    def my_decorator(func):
    	def wrap_func(x):
    		print('------------------')
    		func(x)
    		print('------------------')
    	return wrap_func
    
    @my_decorator
    def hello(greeting):
    	print(greeting)
    
    hello('Whats good with you')
    >
    ------------------
    Whats good with you
    ------------------
    ```
    
    ```python
    #example with brackets
    
    def hello():
    	print("Yo! What's good with you dog")
    
    def my_decorator(func):
    	def wrap_func(*aargs, **kwargs):
    		print('********')
    		func(*aargs, **kwargs)
    		print('********')
    	return wrap_func
    
    @my_decorator
    def hello(greeting, emoji=':)'):
    	print(greeting, emoji)
    
    hello('Hey you')
    
    >
    ********
    Hey you :) 
    ********
    ```
    
    - This little bit here is known as the ‚ÄúDecorator Pattern‚Äù
        
        famous pattern in programming
        
        gives decorator flexibility, pass as many arguments as we want and then unpacking them in our function
        
        ```python
        def my_decorator(func):
        	def warap_func(*aargs, *kwargs):
        		func()
        	return wrap_func
        ```
        

---

- Why do we need Decorators
    
     Best way is to show you so here is the example:
    
    We are going to build a performance decorator, to test how long it takes to complete - we are going to build it from scratch
    
    ```python
    #we havent covered this but just do it for now
    from time import time
    
    def performance_decorator(fn):
    	def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
    		time1 = time()
    		result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
    		time2 = time()
    		print(f'According to my calculations it took exactly: {time2 - time1} ms')
    		return result
    	return wrapper
    
    @performance_decorator
    def long_time():
    	for i in range(100000000):
    			i*20
    
    long_time()
    
    >
    According to my calculations it took exactly: 8.447173595428467 ms
    [Finished in 8.8s]
    ```
    
    - some use cases
        
        logging in decorators
        
        authenticators
        
        django and flask

# Error Handling

<aside>
ü§ñ An error that crashes our program like this = called an exception.

</aside>

ü™≤ unavoidable to avoid bugs and errors - every programmer knows this 

---

Python raises these exceptions whenever the interpreter says, ‚ÄúHey, I have no idea what you're doing, something's wrong, I don't know what I'm doing anymore, I'm going to stop whatever I'm doing and I'm going to give you an output.

> Exceptions can cost a company million of dollars
> 

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "D:\Documents\Coding\Zed python bootcamp\random.py", line 18, in <module>
    long_time('hey')
  File "D:\Documents\Coding\Zed python bootcamp\random.py", line 6, in wrapper
    result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TypeError: long_time() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
[Finished in 357ms]
```

- We have already see a bunch of these errors‚Ä¶
    
    You don‚Äôt have to memorise, can reference on web.
    
    - Dictionary error
    - Key error
    - Zero division error

In the real world, we need to predict users breaking our programs and we need to predict this 

## What is Error Handling

---

<aside>
ü§ñ Error handling is a technique used to identify and handle errors that may occur during the execution of a program.

</aside>

<aside>
‚ùó allows us to let the script continue running, even if there is an error.

</aside>

---

### `try` , `except` , `else`

This is what‚Äôs known as a *‚Äútry, except, else block‚Äù* or *‚Äútry except block‚Äù*

- we use this to test our code
- we can wrap our entire file with this

- In Python, error handling is done using try-except blocks.
    
    ```python
    age = int(input('What is your age'))
    print(age)
    
    #What if the user punches in digits, leaves it blank , or adds letters etc etc. 
    #so we se try: + except:
    
    while True:
    	try:
    		age = int(input('What is your age'))
    		print(age)
    	except:
    		print('please enter a number dumbass')
    	else:
    		print('Thank you kindly!')
    		break
    ```
    

<aside>
ü§î But the above does not solve all our problems you see - as more errors come along with this. 
Perhaps we could get 0 divide errors, type errors etc etc.

</aside>

So what can we do?   We can add more exceptions!

Let use another example:

---

- Example - Using some additional exceptions
    
    A good practice is to always catch these errors based on a specific exception.
    
    - this way you know what the error is and you can be more descriptive.
    
    ```python
    def sum (num1, num2):
    	try
    		return num1 + num2
    	except TypeError as err:
    			print(f"please enter numbers {err}")
    
    print(sum(1, '2'))
    
    #-------------------------
    #really useful to combine different errors if you want to handle them the same way.
    
    def sum (num1, num2):
    
    	try
    		return num1/num2
    
    	except TypeError, zero  as err:
    			print(f"please enter numbers {err}")
    
    print(sum(1, '2'))
    ```
    

---

### `finally:`

This will happen regardless if fail, success, or a new error occurs.

> could be useful:
-  tracking the log in and log out of a game server, 
-  see if someone is trying to break the system etc.
> 

```python
age = int(input('What is your age'))
print(age)

#What if the user punches in digits, leaves it blank , or adds letters etc etc. 
#so we se try: + except:

while True:
	try:
		age = int(input('What is your age'))
		print(age)
	except ValueError:
		print('please enter a number dumbass')
		continue
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print('Please enter age higher than 0')
	else:
		print('Thank you kindly!')
		break
	finally:
		print("Ok this is running useless")
```

---

### `raise:`

sometimes some errors can be so severe we want it to stop

also stop what the program is doing

what if we actually want to raise our own errors?

```python
while True:
	try:
		age = int(input('What is your age'))
		print(age)
		#now if we get this, this will be printed in the terminal error message
		raise Exception("You better stop that right now, ya hear?")
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print('Please enter age higher than 0')
		break
	else:
		print('Thank you kindly!')
		break
	finally:
		print("Ok this is running useless")
```

---

Error handling is an important part of writing robust and reliable code, as it allows you to anticipate and handle potential errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of your program.

# Generators

We already know one type of  ‚Äògenerator‚Äô  -  `range(x)`

- Generators can pause and resume functions ‚Ä¶
    
    what does that mean? - here is an example:
    
    - `range(100)` vs `list(range(100)`
        
        **the list**
        
        the list stores this list in memory
        
        **the range**
        
        this creates them one by one
        
    

So basically it can sometimes be really inefficient to be storing things in memory, so that is why we use generators

<aside>
‚ùó generators are actually iterable.

- That is everything that is a generator is iterable.
- You can iterate over them, but not everything that is iterable is a generator.

---

- For example,
    
    **a range is a generator.**
    *So that is always going to be iterable.*
    
    **But a list is an iterable, but it's not a generator.**
    *So a generator is a subset of an iterable.*
    

---

- A generator is a subset of an iterable.
- The difference between a generator and a regular iterable, is the way we implement them.
</aside>

The difference between a generator and a regular iterable, is the way we implement them.

## What are Generators

---

<aside>
ü§ñ a generator is a special kind of function that does not return a value when it is called, but instead returns a generator object that can be used to execute code lazily. 

When a generator function is called, it does not execute the code in the function body immediately. 
Instead, it returns a generator object that can be used to execute the code in the function body later.

</aside>

- Generators are useful for
    - creating iterators that can be used to iterate over large sequences of data without the need to store the entire sequence in memory at once.
    - allow you to generate values one at a time, as needed, which can save memory and improve performance.

### `yield` + `return`

- Creating a Generator
    
    ---
    
    <aside>
    ‚ùó To create a generator in Python, you use the **`yield`** keyword instead of the **`return`** keyword in a function definition.
    
    </aside>
    
    The **`yield`** keyword is used to return a value from the generator function, but unlike the **`return`** keyword, it does not terminate the generator function.
    
    - Here is an example
        
        ```python
          #using a generator
        #--------------------#
        
        def generator_funtion():
        	for i in range (num):
        		yield i
        
        for item in generator_function():
        	print(item)
        
          #the long alternative
        #-----------------------#
        
        def make_list(num):
        	result = []
        	for i in range(num):
        		result.append(i*2)
        	return result
        
        my_list = make_list(1000)
        ```
        
    - Here is another example of a generator function that generates a sequence of numbers:
        
        ```python
        def count_up_to(max):
            count = 1
            while count <= max:
                yield count
                count += 1
        
        for number in count_up_to(5):
            print(number)
        ```
        
        This generator function, **`count_up_to()`**, yields the values 1 through 5 one at a time when it is iterated over.
        

---

### `next`

the **`next()`** function can be used with generators to retrieve the next value produced by the generator. 

- To use the **`next()`** function with a generator, you must:
    - First you need to create a generator object, by calling the generator function.
    - Then you can use the **`next()`** function to retrieve the next value produced by the generator.

---

- For example:
    
    Here is an example of using the **`next()`** function with a generator:
    
    ```python
    def count_up_to(max):
        count = 1
        while count <= max:
            yield count
            count += 1
    
    # Create a generator object
    counter = count_up_to(5)
    
    # Use the next() function to retrieve the next value from the generator
    print(next(counter))  # 1
    print(next(counter))  # 2
    print(next(counter))  # 3
    print(next(counter))  # 4
    print(next(counter))  # 5
    
    # The generator is exhausted, so the next call to next() raises a StopIteration exception
    try:
        print(next(counter))
    except StopIteration:
        print("End of generator")
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ü§î In this example, the **`count_up_to()`** generator function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5. The generator object is created by calling the generator function, and the **`next()`** function is used to retrieve the values one at a time. When there are no more values to retrieve, the **`next()`** function raises a ‚ÄòStop-Iteration‚Äô exception.
    
    </aside>
    

---

- The **`next()`** function is often used with generators to retrieve values produced by the generator one at a time, without the need to store the entire sequence in memory at once.
- This can improve performance and reduce memory usage, especially when working with large datasets.

---

- Fibonacci exercise
    - Using a generator:
        
        ```python
        def fibonacci(number):    #number is the index number 
        	a = 0
        	b = 1
        	for i in range(number):
        		yield a
        		temp = a
        		a = b
        		b = temp + b
        
        for i in fibonacci(20):
        	print (i)
        >
        0

        8
        13
        21
        34
        ```
        
    - Using a list:
        
        ```python
        **def fibonacci(number):    #number is the index number 
        	a = 0
        	b = 1
        	result = []
        	for i in range(number):
        		result.append(a)
        		temp = a
        		a = b
        		b = temp + b
        	return result
        
        print(fibonacci(10))
        
        >
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]**
        ```
        
    - someone find a very efficient way of doing this  üòâ
        
        ```python
        def fibonacci_gen(num):
            a,b = 0,1
            for _ in range(num):
                yield a
                a,b = b,b+a
        
        for i in fibonacci_gen(10):
