### **DATA SCIENCE**

Data Science, as the name suggests, is about data. It is a multidisciplinary field focused on extracting INFORMATION (insights) that can help a company make better decisions.

For example, if a bank analyzes data collected on its multiple platforms, it can discover which customers are creditworthy (or insolvent) or identify which financial products new customers are buying.

Today, the availability of large volumes of data means more revenue due to Data Science. With **predictive analytics**, it's possible to identify hidden patterns in data you didn't even know existed. For example, an online travel company may find that people traveling with U.S. airlines to Amsterdam opt for a luxurious cruise on the city's canals. Using **prescriptive analytics**, the company can further learn that people who fly in Business prefer an overnight cruise, while those who fly in economy class book bike tours. This data-driven information can be extremely valuable for targeted advertising or cross-selling strategies.

Companies use data science in different ways. Here are some examples of applications:

You might be wondering why some data science apps remind you of AI apps. Well, this is because Data Science overlaps the field of artificial intelligence in many areas. A data scientist uses tools such as statistical models, visualization methods, hypothesis testing, and machine learning algorithms (AI also uses machine learning). A typical Data Science product is based on the application of knowledge in different fields, as shown in the following image:

### **ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)**

To understand what AI is, it's important to understand the historical context. The concept of AI has been around since ancient times: there have been numerous myths and stories of inanimate objects endowed with intelligence by skilled craftsmen.

The seeds of modern AI, however, were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe human thought/intelligence as a symbolic system. The programmable digital computer, the machine based on abstract mathematical reasoning, was first invented in the 1940s based on this work.

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined by *[John McCarthy,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist))* a computer engineer in 1955. Modern AI research formally began in 1956 in a workshop at **Dartmouth College**, a private **Ivy League** research university in New Hampshire.

*Some of the attendees of the AI workshop in 1956 (Image source: [thedartmouth.com](https://www.thedartmouth.com/staff/alex-belser))*

AI research at the time focused on neural networks, inspired by the way neurons work in the human brain. The people who attended this workshop later became leaders in the field.

Until the 1970s, the field was booming with discoveries, but they were far from creating intelligent machines. Initially, they hoped there would be a machine as intelligent as a human being in the 1980s that could read and understand the world around us, and reason like us. But building machines with artificial intelligence wasn't that simple. Limitations in computing processing power also hampered AI's progress. For many decades, AI was limited to research labs.

Machine learning became more popular from the late 1980s to the 2010s. Funding and interest in artificial intelligence peaked in the early 2000s when big tech giants started building supercomputers and investing in artificial intelligence. Deep learning became the focal point for AI researchers around the world.

The following image shows the evolution of AI over the past few decades:

AI is still evolving and is considered a really broad term. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are subsets of Artificial Intelligence.

There is no single definition for AI. It can be said that AI is the capacity that we can endow a machine to allow it:

- Understand/interpret data
- Learning from data
- Make "smart" decisions based on insights and patterns extracted from data.

An AI-powered machine can improve its capability based on "new data" that was not part of the dataset that was first used to train it. For example, a CCTV video surveillance system with artificial intelligence technology to monitor traffic sign violations can improve its ability to detect violations based on new camera footage and corresponding traffic violation fines.

At a fundamental level, AI is a collection of mathematical algorithms that allow computers to understand the correlation between various data elements. In the example of the surveillance system above, the data collected and analysed in real time can be related to traffic lights, turn signals, the position of vehicles at a traffic light, traffic lanes, distance between vehicles, etc. to reach an actionable conclusion, that is, determine a violation for skipping a traffic signal and issue a fine automatically.

In that sense, an AI-powered machine performs tasks mimicking human intelligence, but often, AI goes beyond what is humanly possible.

### **MACHINE LEARNING (ML)**

The term Machine Learning (ML) was coined by [Arthur Samuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Samuel) in 1959.

ML is a subset of AI. It is used in scenarios where you need machines to learn from large volumes of data. The knowledge thus acquired is applied to a new set of data. ML gives a machine the ability to learn from (or about) newer data sets without giving explicit instructions.

![https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c8ac34016b6400b402eab7c/1628257614756-ESWC4XAYH97VRMMPC72U/1_k_OuqnqoqmjGbufq6y-nDQ.png?format=500w](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5c8ac34016b6400b402eab7c/1628257614756-ESWC4XAYH97VRMMPC72U/1_k_OuqnqoqmjGbufq6y-nDQ.png?format=500w)

ML can be said to be the current implementation or application of AI. Some of the most common methods implemented to "make machines learn" are:

- Supervised learning
    - data already has categories and labels - using regression
- Unsupervised learning
    - data points without labels -
    - association rule learning
- Enhanced machine learning
    - reinforcement

In some methods, the machine is informed in advance about the independent (input) and dependent (output) variables. The machine learns the relationship between these two types of variables by analysing a data set called a "training dataset." Before training a data model, a series of data pre-processing steps are performed.

Once a machine has been "trained" enough or when an ML model is ready, it is applied to a new dataset, called a "test dataset."

The ML model enters production mode only after it has been tested enough for reliability and accuracy.

ML involves the use of various algorithms such as: 

- simple linear regression,
- decision tree regression,
- polynomial regression,
- neural networks
- "nearest neighbors K", etc.

ML algorithms can be used to address regression problems, prediction problems, classification problems, etc.

Since machine learning libraries (e.g. SciKit) have evolved a lot in recent years, even programmers with no statistical or AI training experience can start using these libraries to build, train, test, and deploy machine learning models. However, it's always helpful to know exactly how different ML algorithms work so that you fully understand what you're doing.

### What are the 6 steps ML experts do?

    3. avoid future errors
3. Split data. Training Set/Test Set
    1. training set
    2. test set
4. Create a Model
    1. import a library
    2. create an algorithm
5. Check the output
6. Improve

### **DEEP LEARNING (DL)**

You can see DL as a subset or advancement of ML. DL comes into play when ML cannot fully deliver the desired results, although generally, ML is suitable when your dataset is relatively small and is the preferred choice when:

- Data has too many features
- The data is huge
- An extremely high level of accuracy is required

Compared to ML, DL can solve more complex problems, but it is more difficult to implement, as it requires specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs) to run and requires more time to train the model (DL uses neural network models to understand a large amount of data.)

**Siri, Alexa** or **Google Assistant** are some applications that use DL to understand your requests. When **Facebook** recognizes your friends in an image or **Netflix** recommends the type of movies to watch, they are examples of DL applied to a commercial product.

From news aggregators to fake news detection to self-driving cars, natural language processing (NLP), visual recognition, and virtual assistants, DL-based applications are being rolled out in many areas today.

Advances in DL are driving the rise of artificial intelligence. So, yes, DL is one of the hottest topics of the moment.
