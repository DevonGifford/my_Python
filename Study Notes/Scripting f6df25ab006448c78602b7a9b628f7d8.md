- Image processing basics
    
    ```python
    from PIL import Image, ImageFilter
    
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #The Basic stuff
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # img = Image.open('.\image_processing\Pokedex\pikachu.jpg')  #Opening an image
    
    # print(img)          #check the details about the image
    
    # print(img.format)   #check format
    # print(img.size)     #check image size
    # print(img.mode)     #check the 'mode' 
    
    # print(dir(img))     #check all the modules of the image
    
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # # Creating a filter for an image
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # filtered_img = img.filter(ImageFilter.BLUR)
    # filtered_img.save('blur.JPEG', 'JPEG')
    # print (filtered_img)
    # print(filtered_img.format)
    
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # #Showing an image, Rotating an Image, and Resizing an image - (commented out, don't want to do it over and over)
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # # filtered_img.show()
    # # filtered_img.rotate(90)
    # # filtered_img.resize((250,250))
    
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # #Cropping an image
    # #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #box = (100,100,400,400)
    #comment out - region = filtered_img.crop(box)
    #comment out - region.save("cropped_pikachu.png", 'png')
    
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #Downsizing an image 
    #---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    astro = Image.open('./image_processing/Pokedex/astro.jpg')
    
    print('This is the size of the original')
    print(astro.size)
    
    #new_astro = astro.resize((400, 400))
    #new_astro.save('thumbnail_astro.jpg')      #Doing this has compressed our image icorrectly (original size was odd)
    
    astro.thumbnail((400, 400))                 #400x400 is the max for thumbnails, but keeps aspect ration - just FYI
    astro.save('thumbnail_astro.jpg')

# PDF Processing

- Heads up!
    
    Heads up! In the next section you will install [PyPDF2](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (they recently updated their website)
    
    In order to make sure your code works just like mine does in the video, I recommend you install the same version as me. To do this, make sure you type in your command line:
    
    `pip3 install PyPDF2==1.26`
    
    **AND NOT**
    
    `pip3 install PyPDF2` like you see in the video because this will install the latest (and a different version than I am using)
    
    Here is the documentation for the [PyPDF2 API](https://pypdf2.readthedocs.io/en/1.27.12/modules/PageObject.html?highlight=rotate#PyPDF2.pdf.PageObject.rotateClockwise) we will be using in the next couple of videos.**If you DO want to use the latest version of PyPDF2, then here is the code difference you will see:***(minor difference but important if you want the code to work)*
    
    - **What you will see with version 1.26**
        
        ```python
        1. template = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('super.pdf', 'rb'))
        2. watermark = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(open('wtr.pdf', 'rb'))
        3. output = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()
        4.  
        5. for i in range(template.getNumPages()):
        6.   page = template.getPage(i)
        7.   page.mergePage(watermark.getPage(0))
        8.   output.addPage(page)
        9.  
        10.   with open('watermarked_output.pdf', 'wb') as file:
        11.     output.write(file)
        ```
        
    - **What you need to do with latest version:**
        
        ```python
        1. template = PyPDF2.PdfReader(open('super.pdf', 'rb'))
        2. watermark = PyPDF2.PdfReader(open('wtr.pdf', 'rb'))
        3. output = PyPDF2.PdfWriter()
        4.  
        5. for i in range(len(template.pages)):
        6.     page = template.pages[i]
        7.     page.merge_page(watermark.pages[0])
        8.     output.add_page(page)
        9.  
        10.     with open('watermarked.pdf', 'wb') as file:
        11.         output.write(file)
        ```
        
    
    Happy coding!

opening a pdf

few things:

I find that I have to run my file from the terminal in order to get this to work.  *(cannot build)*

```python
import PyPDF2

with open('.\dummy.pdf', 'r') as file:       #'r' is for reading the file 
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
    print(reader.numPages)

>
PdfReadWarning: PdfFileReader stream/file object is not in binary mode. It may not be read correctly.
```

<aside>
☝ Therefore, we need to change our `'r'` (for read) to `'br'` (for binary reader)

</aside>

```python
import PyPDF2

with open('.\dummy.pdf', 'br') as file:
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(file)
    print(reader.numPages)

>
1  

the 1 indicates how many pages are in this pdf

```

- Most advanced exercise with comments explaining everything I did:
    
    ```python
    import sys
    import re
    import PyPDF2
    
    #taking inputs - ignoring the first argument, which is the name of the script itself.
    
    inputs = sys.argv[1:]
    
    #check if files are a pdf with regex
    def pdf_watermark(list_files, watermarkpage):
        pdfPattern = re.compile(r'^(.*)\.pdf$')
    
        for file in list_files:
            #checking if the file is a pdf 
            filecheck = pdfPattern.search(file)
            if filecheck != None:
                #getting the file name withouth the .pdf at the end
                filename = filecheck.group()
                fileprefix = filecheck.group(1)
    
                with open(filename, 'rb') as read_file:             #Open the PDF file for reading ('rb' mode)
                    read_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(read_file)      #Create a PdfFileReader object
                    watermarked_pdf = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()        #Create a new PdfFileWriter object for the watermarked PDF file.
    
                    #watermarking each page
                    for page in range(read_pdf.getNumPages()):      #This will iterate over each page in the PDF file.
                        print(f"Processing page {page+1} of {read_pdf.getNumPages()}")
                        pdf_page = read_pdf.getPage(page)       #this gets each page
                        pdf_page.mergePage(watermarkpage)       #this merges the page with watermark file
                        watermarked_pdf.addPage(pdf_page)       #ths adds the resulting watermarked page to the watermarked_pdf object.
                    
                    #write new watermarked_file and append the name with '_watermarked' page

    [email: Examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/email.examples.html)
    
- **SMTP**
    - **What is SMTP**
        
        **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol**
        
        Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer mail from one user to another. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail, whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiver’s side.
        
        **SMTP Fundamentals**
        
        SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. 
        
        The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.
        
    - **SMTP Protocol**
        
        The SMTP model is of two types:
        
        1. End-to-end method
        2. Store-and- forward method
        
        ---
        
        The end-to-end model is used to communicate between different organizations whereas the store and forward method is used within an organization. An SMTP client who wants to send the mail will contact the destination’s host SMTP directly, in order to send the mail to the destination. The SMTP server will keep the mail to itself until it is successfully copied to the receiver’s SMTP. 
        
        The client SMTP is the one that initiates the session so let us call it client- 
        
        SMTP and the server SMTP is the one that responds to the session request so let us call it receiver-SMTP. 
        
        The client- SMTP will start the session and the receiver-SMTP will respond to the request.
        
    - **Model of SMTP system**
        
        In the SMTP model user deals with the user agent (UA), for example, Microsoft Outlook, Netscape, Mozilla, etc. In order to exchange the mail using TCP, MTA is used. The user sending the mail doesn’t have to deal with MTA as it is the responsibility of the system admin to set up a local MTA. The MTA maintains a small queue of mails so that it can schedule repeat delivery of mails in case the receiver is not available. The MTA delivers the mail to the mailboxes and the information can later be downloaded by the user agents.
        
        ![https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2017/02/SMTP_1.png](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/gq/2017/02/SMTP_1.png)
        
    - **Both the SMTP-client and SMTP-server should have 2 components:**
        1. User-agent (UA)
        2. Local MTA
            
            **Communication between sender and the receiver :** 
            
            *The sender’s user agent prepares the message and sends it to the MTA. The MTA’s responsibility is to transfer the mail across the network to the receiver’s MTA. To send mails, a system must have a client MTA, and to receive mails, a system must have a server MTA.*
            
            **SENDING EMAIL:** 
            
            *Mail is sent by a series of request and response messages between the client and the server. The message which is sent across consists of a header and a body. A null line is used to terminate the mail header and everything after the null line is considered as the body of the message, which is a sequence of ASCII characters. The message body contains the actual information read by the receipt.*
            
            **RECEIVING EMAIL:** 
            
            *The user agent at the server-side checks the mailboxes at a particular time of intervals. If any information is received, it informs the user about the mail. When the user tries to read the mail it displays a list of emails with a short description of each mail in the mailbox. By selecting any of the mail users can view its contents on the terminal.*
            
    - **Some SMTP Commands:**
        - HELO – Identifies the client to the server, fully qualified domain name, only sent once per session
        - MAIL – Initiate a message transfer, fully qualified domain of originator
        - RCPT – Follows MAIL, identifies an addressee, typically the fully qualified name of the addressee, and for multiple addressees use one RCPT for each addressee
        - DATA – send data line by line
    - **Advantages of SMTP:**
        - If necessary, the users can have a dedicated server.
        - It allows for bulk mailing.
        - Low cost and wide coverage area.
        - Offer choices for email tracking.
        - reliable and prompt email delivery.
    - **Disadvantages of SMTP:**
        - SMTP’s common port can be blocked by several firewalls.
        - SMTP security is a bigger problem.
        - Its simplicity restricts how useful it can be.
        - Just 7 bit ASCII characters can be used.
        - If a message is longer than a certain length, SMTP servers may reject the entire message.
        - Delivering your message will typically involve additional back-and-forth processing between servers, which will delay sending and raise the likelihood that it won’t be sent.

### `import requests`

[requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

- allow us to make a requests
- kind of like having a broswer without having a browser’https
- this is an API - we will learn more about API’s later in the bootcamp

---

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' + 'example_passsword@123'
res = requests.get(url)
>400

400 = bad - smething went wrong or access denied from api
200 = good 
We will learn morea about this later
```

<aside>
☝ the reason this happened, this api uses something called ‘Hashing’ - lets learn more in next session

- what is hashing?
    
    Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value that is shorter and fixed-length1. Hashing is used to implement hash tables, which are data structures that store and retrieve items efficiently2. Hashing can also be used for cybersecurity purposes, such as verifying data integrity or authenticating users3.
    

---

- hashing algorithm makes it into something gibberish - so we never send our password
- there are many types MD5, SHA256 etc. etc.
- this API uses ‘SHA1’

- This is not safe because someone could access the hash algorithm and therefore figure out our password

<aside>
☝ This still doesn’t work or is not a safe way to do this, we need to use ***“K-anonymity”***

- What is K-anonymity
    
    this is a way big websites and advertisers track what we do on the web without knowing too much more - who we are etc.
    
    > K-anonymity is a property possessed by certain anonymized data. [It means that each record in a dataset cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 other records based on some identifying attributes**1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity). [K-anonymity is an attempt to protect privacy when disclosing information**2**](https://www.privitar.com/blog/k-anonymity-an-introduction/). [It is often achieved by generalizing or suppressing some values in the data**3**](https://www.immuta.com/blog/k-anonymity-everything-you-need-to-know-2021-guide/).
    >

So how do we get around this with this k-anonymity?

- well we send the first 5 digits to the api
- the api will respond with all the hash’s that have those first 5 digits.
- then on our end - we will compare our full hash to the hashes that have been sent to us
- if there is a match - we know our password has been figured out 😟

### import `hashlib` (built-in module)

[hashlib — Secure hashes and message digests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html)

- Getting the hash key ready to send to api - practice and understanding:
    
    ```python
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For context:
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    import requests 
    import hashlib
    
    # password = example_password@123
    # full_hash = 3EAE24D094788E1F26E197AC74B3AB54BC866D51
    # short_hash = 3EAE2
    
    #now we write a program to deal with the response of potntially 1000's of hash keys
    
    def request_api_data(querey_char):
        url = 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' + querey_char
        res = requests.get(url)
    
        if res.status_code != 200:   #meaning that it worked (remember 200 is error and 400 means it worked)
            raise RuntimeError (f'Error fetching: {res.status_code}, check the api and try again')
        return res
    
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Lets experiment a bit here:  we are getting our hash key ready to send to the api
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    def pwened_api_check(password):
        print(password.encode('utf-8'))                                              #1
    		print(hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')))                                #2
    		print(hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest())                    #3
    		print(hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().uppper())           #4
        
    
    pwened_api_check('123')  >b'123'                                                #1
    pwened_api_check('123')  ><sha1 _hashlib.HASH object @ 0x0000020E0CBE6630>      #2
    pwened_api_check('123')  >40bd001563085fc35165329ea1ff5c5ecbdbbeef              #3
    pwened_api_check('123')  >40BD001563085FC35165329EA1FF5C5ECBDBBEEF              #4
    ```
    
- We only send the first 5 character:
    
    ```python
    #check if password exists in api
    def pwned_api_check(password):
        #we are getting our hash key ready to send to the api
        sha1password = (hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()) #see notion for whats happening here
        first5, tail = sha1password[:5], sha1password[5:] 
        response = request_api_data(first5)
        print (first5, tail)     >40BD0 01563085FC35165329EA1FF5C5ECBDBBEEF
        print (response)         ><Response [200]>
        return response
       
    pwned_api_check('123')
    ```
    
- Lets try and read the response we get:
    
    ```python
    import requests 
    import hashlib
    
    # password = example_password@123
    # full_hash = 3EAE24D094788E1F26E197AC74B3AB54BC866D51
    # short_hash = 3EAE2
    
    #now we write a program to deal with the response of potntially 1000's of hash keys
    
    def request_api_data(querey_char):

            raise RuntimeError (f'Error fetching: {res.status_code}, check the api and try again')
        return res
    
    def read_res(response):                    **#This is a quick function to print out all the responses we get from api**
        print(response.text)
    
    #check if password exists in api
    def pwned_api_check(password):
        #we are getting our hash key ready to send to the api
        sha1password = (hashlib.sha1(password.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest().upper()) #see notion for whats happening here
        first5, tail = sha1password[:5], sha1password[5:] 
        response = request_api_data(first5)
        print (first5, tail)
        print (response)
        return read_res(response)              **#we had to change this to print uout the response here**

- Quick lecture on Hashing:
    
    The upcoming video is from another course: **[Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://zerotomastery.io/courses)**
    we are just going to look at it very briefly:
    
    - what is hash function?
        
        > *Hashing is the process of transforming any given key or a string of characters into another value that is shorter and fixed-length1. Hashing is used to implement hash tables, which are data structures that store and retrieve items efficiently2. Hashing can also be used for cybersecurity purposes, such as verifying data integrity or authenticating users3.*
        > 
        - a function that generates a value of  fixed length for each input it gets
        - there are many types of hash algorithms/functions
        - so, if we type something in the hash - it will give us some crazy output
    - For example lets compare some hashes of very similar things and see how different they are:
        
        > hello = AAF4C61DDCC5E8A2DABEDE0F3B482CD9AEA9434D        *
        hell = A5CEC7AF5F7AAB769CF0D4AA440E01C7BFC371B2
        Hello = F7FF9E8B7BB2E09B70935A5D785E0CC5D9D0ABF0
        hello = AAF4C61DDCC5E8A2DABEDE0F3B482CD9AEA9434D        *note the output is the same as the first ‘hello’
        > 
    
    This is something called **idempotent**
    
    - what is **idempotent?**
        
        fancy way of saying a function given an input always outputs the same output
        
        > *Idempotent can be an adjective meaning denoting an element of a set which is unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by itself1. It can also be a noun meaning an idempotent element1. Idempotent can also refer to a property of HTTP methods, where multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request2.*
